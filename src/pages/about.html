                <p><strong>IT Analyst</strong> :: <em>June 2023 - November 2023</em> :: Duncan, SC</p>
                <p>It is with absolute certainty that I can say this has been my favorite job in my career thus far. The
                    job itself was an entertaining challenge, the people I worked with were mostly very personable and easy to get along with, and
                    there were no massive red flags that took place during my time. Given the opportunity and the right location, I would work for Timken
                    again. It's not perfect, but it's given me the least trouble.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Responded to, worked on, and resolved problem tickets as they came in: printer issues and toner
                        refills, computer software and hardware problems, user accounts, software and hardware installation, and label printer repair.
                        Issues with printers that could not immediately be fixed or were otherwise outside of the scope of IT (broken or malfunctioning
                        parts, special access required) were forwarded to a third party. </li>
                    <li>Replaced and updated warehouse shop floor machines Windows OS to company standard. Machines that
                        could not be updated or were otherwise problematic were replaced with newly imaged machines. </li>
                    <li>Repaired and replaced label printers as needed; warehouse had a surplus of label printers, so
                        any needed parts for the printers could be pulled from decommissioned ones with minimal wait time. Adjusted print hardware to
                        produce quality prints. </li>
                    <li>Created and deployed internal page for auditing packed orders using HTML, CSS, JS, and Classic
                        ASP, and T-SQL. Page was made to more display and more accurately capture issues with audited orders and scale to 8-inch tablet
                        screens. </li>
                    <li>Prepared and deployed Android-based warehouse scanners to company specifications. Scanners setup
                        with Android Enterprise required collaboration with overseas team to download and install software and
                        network certificates for the internal network. Those scanners not deployed sit in storage, ready to deploy or replace at any time.

                    eCommerce aspects of the business (creating and maintaining product listings and inventory between multiple systems); before finally
                    getting more into the data of the business (creating reports to find errors and datasheets for mass migration to and from
                    systems). A mixture of high prices, limited supply, and the overall niche of the products sold eventually ended the
                    company. <a href="https://oldsouthtrade.com">While the domain still appears to exist</a>, the store&#39;s Shopify page does not. Their Amazon page is still up, but

                I feel that its important to note that bad jobs, whether they're unreasonable in some way or just a bad
                fit for an individual, deserve to and should be discussed as such. QS/1 was not a good fit for me, at least in support. I'm told it was a
                great place to work for a long time, but as leadership has changed, so has the forecast for employees. I made a great number of friends
                and connections while working, learned a lot about working in an office environment and how to work with customers of various
                demeanors, how to professionally address interpersonal issues within and between teams, and what "superpowers" each person can have. But, the
                job's responsibilities and expectations were not a fit for who I was or who I wanted to be. I will always hold the lessons I
                learned there in high regard, both positive and negative.

                At the time, working at Amazon was a big deal to me. While the work I did didn't feel particularly
                impactful, the spirit of some of my coworkers kept me going. My biggest complaint about the work was that it was repetitive and
                monotonous; get products from location, drop them off in designated drop areas, rinse and repeat. However, this also meant that there was never
                any question about what to do. As an Ambassador, essentially a dedicated trainer and knowledge source, I took my chances to help
                seriously and always did my best to provide accurate information and/or point coworkers in the right direction. I still keep in contact with
                some of the people I worked with and they tell me about others who still remember me.

                USC Upstate is a fantastic campus and reportedly a great place to get a computer science degree.
                However, their computer science program doesn't offer <em>any</em> online class options or support. When I
                started in 2020, their solution to remote classes wasn't well planned or implemented; there was no lecture, live or
                recorded, and assignments were simply unlocked every week. We were told to email our instructors or use an instant
                messaging system to attempt to reach them, but they were rarely timely about it. Since the campus has reopened,
                I've been able to take a few classes, but again, because the classes don't have online or hybrid options, I've
                effectively stalled. I would love to continue taking classes, even if it means taking time out of my work day to do it
                because I feel the results will be worth the effort. I am currently researching other universities that I may be able to
                attend online, though a hybrid role may allow me to take classes on remote days.

                backend, frontend, cloud, or mobile. Developing my projects, no matter what size, gives me a sense of purpose and goal to work toward. 
                Even making this webpage is something that I enjoy watching the progress of: going from a blank white page to something aesthetically pleasing, 
                even if it's minimally interactive or animated. Building options in to demo them for the people who will be using them to get their feedback 
                is always a nice experience because I enjoy learning about how things work and what makes one option better than another option (thus, this page 
                includes minimal JS.)

                While IT work is certainly interesting, I find development more productive for what I like to do.
                Development, from the learning to the implementation, has always been a great interest of mine, as understanding and fixing a problem or 
                having a vision of a piece of software, website, or process and making it a reality can be so satisfying. I plan to get an AWS Cloud Practicioner
                certification and am considering a similar certification for Azure. I practice my development skills by using challenges and small ideas from 
                newsletters I subscribe to and functional gaps (intentional or otherwise) in services and apps that I use. As more of these projects take better 
                shape, I do plan on pushing them to GitHub or a similar service. I would love to hear what I may be able to do for you and your company.
