# Personal Page with Astro

This is my personal website generated on StackBlitz and using Astro. This page is made to be a bit more flexible than something like Squarespace or Geocities
as I feel I've learned enough to learn to make my own components. 

Please note that there's nothing otherwise special about this project; there are no secrets or anything like that, just some basic information.
If you're interested in starting your own website or blog with Astro, you can visit [astro.build](https://astro.build) to get started on your local machine 
or [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) to get started in the cloud with Astro or just about any other popular Javascript-based framework. 

âš  There are still broken links on the site as I try to standardize some of the places I'd like to link to. Patience is appreciated.
